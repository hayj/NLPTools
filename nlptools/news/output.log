2019-11-14 12:08:23,950 :: INFO :: Some of the state largest employers weighed in Tuesday on the Hartford HealthCare and Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield contract impasse, calling for resolution of a disagreement over reimbursements for medical treatment that threatens coverage for tens of thousands of patients.
"We expect a resolution that improves health care quality and access, and insures that high quality care remains affordable for both patients and employers, the employers said in a letter.
"It is in everyone collective best interest including your own to immediately return to the negotiating table and resolve this dispute once and for all.
The letter was addressed to Jill Hummel, president and general manager of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield in Connecticut and Elliot Joseph, president and CEO of Hartford HealthCare.
It was signed by State Comptroller Kevin Lembo, West Hartford Mayor Shari Cantor, West Hartford Town Manager Matthew Hart, Mohegan Tribal Chairman Kevin Brown, and Bob Tessier, executive director of the CT Coalition of Taft - Hartley Health Funds.
Jeff Hamilton, assistant general manager of the Mohegan Sun, said as many as of the employees at the casino and resort are affected by the dispute.
Mohegan Sun, which is self - insured, pays Anthem to administer its health insurance, he said.
Mohegan Sun spends more than __int_2__ million a year for costs related to Hartford HealthCare and leaders of the tribal business worry about escalating health care costs, some of which are passed on to employees.
"It goes on the backs of our team members, he said.
For years, Hartford HealthCare and Anthem negotiated rates, which included the hospital group in the insurer network of providers.
But their most recent contract expired Sept. __int_2__ and the parties, trading accusations of greed and intimidation, have been unable to agree to new rates for certain medical care.
In the absence of an agreement, Hartford HealthCare has been removed from Anthem network of health providers, leaving tens of thousands of Connecticut patients with the prospect of higher out - of - pocket, out - of - network costs for treatment.
Patients with "true emergency conditions" can receive treatment at any Hartford HealthCare facilities and pay the in - network rate.
Hartford HealthCare said last week that "we are deeply concerned that we remain far apart at this date, and do not appear to be close to a resolution.
The Hartford HealthCare network includes Hartford Hospital, the Hospital of Central Connecticut in New Britain, MidState Medical Center in Meriden, Backus Hospital in Norwich, Windham Hospital in Willimantic and the Institute of Living, a Hartford - based institution that treats mental illness and other health conditions.
Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Connecticut is part of one of the nation largest health benefits companies, which provides coverage to one in eight Americans.
Hundreds of thousands of private and public employees in Connecticut are, or could be affected by the dispute over how much Anthem should pay Hartford HealthCare to reimburse it for the costs of medical treatment it provides.
A significant portion of those patients are state employees.
Thomas Woodruff, director of the health care policy and benefit services division of the state comptroller office, sent a letter to Anthem members on the state health plan who have used HHC providers.
In the letter, he outlined their health care alternatives during "this unacceptable disruption" and included a list of Connecticut hospitals that can be used to avoid paying higher costs for nonemergency care.
To avoid financial risk, we recommend that Anthem members do not seek non - emergency care at any HHC facility, Woodruff said.
Anthem and HHC are keeping details of their talks private.
But last week, the bargaining agent for state employee unions complained based, it said, on facts it received from large, self - insured employers that that the pace at which Hartford HealthCare is pursuing rate increases suggests it is interested more in growth than the delivery of treatment.
"Those facts include Hartford Healthcare receipt of increases compounding at over __int_2__ in the last __int_1__ years, and demanding increases over __int_1__ per year in the upcoming agreement, the union letter said.
"And Hartford Healthcare use of ever increasing amounts of healthcare dollars in what appears at least to be driven more by an attempt to gain market share and power than an effort to improve medical services for patients and communities.
The employee unions and other sources also said Hartford HealthCare rejected a temporary measure by which Anthem would reimburse it under rates in the expired contract with a promise to retroactively compensate the hospital network for any increase in rates negotiated in the next contract.
Hartford HealthCare said it is negotiating in good faith, as evidenced by its ability to reach agreements with other insurers.
"Hartford HealthCare has been in active negotiations with Anthem since Oct. __int_2__ ample time to reach an agreement, a spokesman said.
"HHC spends many months negotiating agreements with insurance companies; in all cases except with Anthem, we always find common ground.
A good example is HHC ability to enter a contract with Aetna three months early, which we announced last month.
The letter Friday by large employers complained the impasse in negotiations is "creating unnecessary stress and anxiety.
"As the impasse drags into its fifth week, our employees, members and their families are expressing heightened frustration with both Hartford HealthCare and Anthem, the letter said.
"Their frustration and desire for in - network care is driving many to consider other health care options.
In mid - October, Connecticut congressional delegation wrote to Anthem and Hartford HealthCare expressing their concern for the patients and policyholders "affected by the ongoing impasse.
They called the stalemate "disruptive and a disservice" to patients and customers.

Jan. 20 (Bloomberg) -- China's growth accelerated to a more-than-forecast 9.8
percent in the fourth quarter, adding pressure for more monetary tightening to
counter inflation.
The expansion reported by the statistics bureau in Beijing today compared with
a 9.6 percent annual gain in the previous three months. The median estimate in
a Bloomberg News survey of 22 economists was 9.4 percent. Consumer prices rose
6 percent in December, matching the median forecast.
Chinese officials may keep ratcheting up bank reserve requirements and allow
more gains in the yuan after the currency strengthened to a 17-year high as
President Hu Jintao visited the U.S. this week. The World Bank sees
"considerable scope" for higher benchmark interest rates, with Citigroup Inc.
and Credit Suisse Group AG estimating that inflation may peak at as much as 6
percent in the first half.
"Growth won't be a problem this year," said Zhuang Jian, a Beijing-based
economist with the Asian Development Bank, before today's release. "Inflation
remains the top immediate risk for the economy."
December's inflation compared with November's 5.1 percent annual pace, which
was the fastest in more than two years. For 2010 as a whole, consumer prices
rose 3.3 percent, breaching a government target of 3 percent.
Overtaking Japan
China's economy expanded 10.3 percent in 2010 to 39.8 trillion yuan ($6.04
trillion), the fastest pace in three years, the statistics bureau report
showed. That compared with 9.2 percent in 2009. The nation's standing as the
world's No. 2 economy may be confirmed on Feb. 14 when Japan reports gross
domestic product for the fourth quarter.
Urban fixed-asset investment rose 24.5 percent in 2010 from a year earlier.
Retail sales grew at an annual 19.1 percent in December, partly boosted by
inflation, and industrial production rose 13.5 percent, the statistics bureau
said. Producer prices jumped 5.9 percent.
Premier Wen Jiabao pledged this week to prevent "abnormal" loan growth amid
concern that resurgent lending may add to excess money in the financial
system, fueling asset bubbles and inflation.
China's foreign-exchange reserves jumped by a record $199 billion in the
fourth quarter and new loans breached the government's target for 2010.
Companies from Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. to Starbucks Corp. and McDonald's
Corp. have raised prices.
Policy makers' commitment to taming inflation means they risk "overshooting"
and causing a slowdown that hampers the global recovery, Allen Sinai,
president of Decision Economics in New York, said in an interview in Tokyo
this week.
The central bank will increase the key one-year lending rate to 6.81 percent
from 5.81 percent this year and let the yuan gain about 6 percent against the
dollar, Nomura Holdings Inc. estimated this week.
The Chinese currency closed yesterday at 6.5824 per dollar, with President
Barack Obama telling counterpart Hu that the yuan remains undervalued and
gains so far have "not been fast enough." Chinese Commerce Minister Chen
Deming said U.S. export controls and China's role in global manufacturing
helped to explain the nations' trade imbalance.
China aims to hold inflation at 4 percent for the full year, state television
reported last month, citing the National Development and Reform Commission,
the top economic planning agency.
Inflation of even that level is "serious" in China, according to Ma Jun,
Deutsche Bank AG's chief China economist. "People are used to low inflation
and high inflation will easily cause social discontent," he said, citing a 1.6
percent average annual rate for the 10 years through 2009\.
The central bank has raised reserve ratios for the largest banks to 19
percent, excluding any extra requirements for individual lenders. Still,
local-currency lending has already exceeded 1 trillion yuan in the year to
date, the 21st Century Business Herald reported, citing an unidentified person
familiar with the matter. Lending was 481 billion yuan in December.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose by the most in five weeks
yesterday after speculation that the December inflation number had leaked and
was 4.6 percent, less than November's rate.

2019-11-14 12:08:24,631 :: INFO :: This recap contains spoilers for Riverdale Season 1, episode 1, titled "The River's Edge."
"Our story is about a town, a small town, and the people who live in the town. From a distance, it presents itself like so many other small towns all over the world: safe, decent, innocent. Get closer though, and you start seeing the shadows underneath. The name of our town is Riverdale. And our story begins, I guess, with what the Blossom twins did this summer … "
Riverdale, The CW's live-action Archie comics drama, aims to subvert any and all assumptions you have about Archie Andrews (KJ Apa) and his friends from over 75 years of comic books.
This isn't your grandparents' Archie – this dark, scandalous tale, equal parts Twin Peaks and Gossip Girl, is a lot more like recent iterations of Archie comic book stories, rather than the rosy-cheeked, aw-shucks gang that first debuted in digests back in 1941.
Narrating the whole saga for us in live-action is the moody, sardonic voice of Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse), hardly seen in the series premiere but always heard as he tries to make sense of the town's biggest scandal.
Just after dawn on the 4th of July, the Blossom twins, Jason (Trevor Stines) and Cheryl (Madelaine Petsch), went for a boat ride, and later that day Cheryl was found soaked and alone on the river's edge and Jason was gone. Cheryl's story was that their boat capsized and Jason never surfaced, so their parents buried an empty casket and his death was ruled an accident. His body was never found … until the first week of the new school year, opening up an official murder investigation where everyone is a potential suspect, even his twin sister — who creepily refers to her brother as her "soul mate." Is Riverdale really going there with twin-cest and twin-tracide right out of the gate?
But we'll get to that later. First, let's meet the newest incarnations of the Archie gang and dig into all the secrets that the town of Riverdale is hiding.
New girl Veronica Lodge rolls into town fresh off her father's incarceration for fraud and embezzlement. Her mother Hermione (Marisol Nichols) claims their apartment is the only piece of property in her name and not her corrupt husband's, but after getting a duffel bag full of money anonymously delivered by their doorman Smithers (Tom McBeath), it's clear there is more going on than Veronica realizes.
Camila Mendes as Veronica Lodge Image: Diyah Pera/THE CW
The most interesting thing to note about The CW's version of the bratty, elitist rich girl from the comics is that Mendes has been given the green light to fully humanize Veronica. Where she was once evil and manipulative in the comics, now she's empathetic.
She's not perfect, of course, and still makes some mistakes – mostly where her new crush "Archiekins" is concerned – but she's committed to becoming a better person after realizing that she was basically a spoiled, entitled rich bitch before father's arrest. She's using her move to Riverdale as a fresh start, an opportunity to become the best version of herself. Finally, Veronica is a relatable character.
Meanwhile, classic girl-next-door Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) is hiding more than enough secrets of her own. Where Veronica is now a flawed hero in her own right — one who's even committed to helping Betty realize her full potential — Betty has enough baggage and emotional damage to employ a therapist full-time... but she would never admit to that.
Her overbearing mother, already burdening her with the stress of college applications even though Betty is only a sophomore, pushes her into Adderall abuse, and the whole family is seemingly haunted by the mysterious events surrounding Betty's older sister, who's currently living in a group home after her relationship with Jason Blossom prompted a nervous breakdown of some kind, apparently "ruining" her.
But Betty desperately pushes all those issues down to maintain the perfect facade of … well, perfection. Helping distract her from all the cracks starting to show in her psyche is her crush on her BFF Archie, whom she hasn't seen all summer. Encouraged by her gay best friend (and the first openly gay character in the Archie universe) Kevin Keller (Casey Cott), Betty decides to finally tell Archie how she feels … especially since, in the wise words of Kevin, "Archie got hot. He's got abs now!"

Did you really expect anything less from The CW's live-action Archie? Yes, working for his father Fred (Luke Perry) all summer in construction had worked wonders on the redheaded teen. Not only had he developed jaw-dropping muscle definition, the physical busywork gave him a lot of time alone with his thoughts, helping him realize how passionate he is about composing music.
When he divulges his new secret to Betty, she practically turns into the heart-eyes emoji. Hot, sweet and gifted with a knack for catchy pop ballads? He's the total package. But right as she's pouring her heart out to her best-friend-turned-potential-soulmate, Veronica walks into Pop's Chock-lit Shoppe, and by the look on his face, it's clear that the classic Archie/Betty/Veronica love triangle is born.
But as has been repeatedly emphasized, this is not your classic Archie. He's also harboring quite a scandalous secret — more so than contemplating quitting football or telling his father that he wants to forgo inheriting his father's construction company for a career in music: he's been engaging in an illicit teacher/student relationship with the now young and hot Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel) all summer long.
No one knows about their affair, but that all could change as Archie struggles with whether or not come forward about what he heard on the morning of the 4th of July. He and Ms. Grundy were getting in some, ahem, "alone time" at the river's edge when they both heard a gunshot.
Not knowing back then that Jason Blossom would turn up dead, they tried to forget what they heard, knowing they couldn't come forward or else Grundy would get in major trouble — but with the discovery of Jason's body with a bullet hole in his forehead, there's no way Archie can keep quiet about the mysterious gunshot.
Grundy does her best to convince Archie not to come forward, but this is Archie we're talking about – as girl-crazy and dumb as this iconic teenage boy can be, he's still a good person who always tries to do the right thing, especially with his father teaching him the value of honesty. There is an expiration date on both of their secrets, and the only question is when will it all get exposed?

Betty and Veronica, oblivious to Archie's tawdry affair with Grundy, convince Archie to join them on a trio group friend date to the back-to-school semi-formal dance, and Betty finally does get to confess her feelings to Archie. He doesn't respond to her at first, and at Cheryl's after-party he's "forced" to spend seven minutes in heaven with Veronica.
Of course, they can't deny their attraction: Archie and Veronica kiss, and he realizes he doesn't feel the same way about Betty that she does about him. He tries to let her down easy later that night, telling her that she is so perfect that he's not good enough for her, which, in typical boy fashion, he doesn't realize is the exact wrong thing to say. Betty's far from perfect, but she hides it so well from those closest to her, and now that's costing her the one thing she wants most: Archie.
A shining beacon of light in the dark town is the empowered, confident and strong Josie McCoy (Ashleigh Murray) and her Pussycats. With record-ready voices and attitude to back up their talent, the Pussycats know they're bound for stardom despite being trapped in their small town.

When Archie approaches Josie with songs he wrote, hoping to learn from her musical expertise and hopefully to convince the Pussycats to perform them, she shuts him down immediately, letting him know they're all about building their brand and telling their own story with songs they write. And thus begins the iconic rivalry between Josie and Archie and their musical aspirations.
Other noteworthy moments:
- Jughead's narration is revealed at the very end of the premiere to be the basis of a novel about all the events of the summer, starting with Jason's death. Also interesting to note is that he and Archie are ex-best friends, which seems almost blasphemous to Archie fans but is extremely compelling to watch onscreen. Apparently, Archie did something to Jughead and never talked to him about it, ruining their relationship. Instead of letting him destroy another relationship, Jughead helps Archie realize in a tense conversation at Pop's that he needs to talk to Betty to save their friendship, lest they end up as strained as Archie and Jughead.
- Hermione and Fred dated in high school. It's going to be pretty awkward when Veronica and Archie find out their parents got hot and heavy after the teens shared a steamy make out sesh.
- Another steamy make out comes courtesy of Veronica helping Betty put Cheryl in her place during River Vixen cheerleading tryouts. Cheryl tries to shame Betty's goody-two-shoes exterior for lacking "heat" and "sizzle," so Veronica ends her tirade by kissing Betty in front of the whole squad. Veronica helps both of them make the team, but as a downside, they now have to put up with Cheryl on a daily basis.

But when Cheryl tries to goad Betty into finally letting her feelings out, all it does is cause Betty to ball her fists so hard she makes herself bleed before once again swallowing her anger and emotions to maintain that good girl image. The troubled teen is already at her breaking point, and it's clear she'll go to any lengths necessary to keep maintain her illusion of control.
- Moose is gay! Well, closeted, but he definitely propositions Kevin in the bathroom for a little heavy petting that escalates into a late-night meet-up down at Sweetwater River. Unfortunately, their secret hookup comes to a screeching halt when they discover Jason Blossom's dead body floating at the water's edge, with a clear bullet hole in his forehead, marking the beginning of the series' big murder mystery.
- Archie ends up making a deal with Grundy: he won't come forward about July 4th, essentially keeping her safe from anyone discovering their affair, but only if she helps mentor him with his music. She agrees, under the impression that they'll keep things strictly professional, but that's clearly not going to happen. At least for now, he can juggle music lessons before school, football practice after school and working for his dad on weekends, so it's not like he has to choose any particular path yet.
- Jason's autopsy will be performed on Monday, and by Tuesday the first arrest will be made. The first, but certainly not the last.
Riverdale airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. on The CW.

2019-11-14 12:08:24,633 :: INFO :: This recap contains spoilers for Riverdale Season 1, episode 1, titled "The River's Edge."
"Our story is about a town, a small town, and the people who live in the town. From a distance, it presents itself like so many other small towns all over the world: safe, decent, innocent. Get closer though, and you start seeing the shadows underneath. The name of our town is Riverdale. And our story begins, I guess, with what the Blossom twins did this summer ... "
Riverdale, The CW's live-action Archie comics drama, aims to subvert any and all assumptions you have about Archie Andrews (KJ Apa) and his friends from over 75 years of comic books.
This isn't your grandparents' Archie — this dark, scandalous tale, equal parts Twin Peaks and Gossip Girl, is a lot more like recent iterations of Archie comic book stories, rather than the rosy-cheeked, aw-shucks gang that first debuted in digests back in 1941.
Narrating the whole saga for us in live-action is the moody, sardonic voice of Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse), hardly seen in the series premiere but always heard as he tries to make sense of the town's biggest scandal.
Just after dawn on the 4th of July, the Blossom twins, Jason (Trevor Stines) and Cheryl (Madelaine Petsch), went for a boat ride, and later that day Cheryl was found soaked and alone on the river's edge and Jason was gone. Cheryl's story was that their boat capsized and Jason never surfaced, so their parents buried an empty casket and his death was ruled an accident. His body was never found ... until the first week of the new school year, opening up an official murder investigation where everyone is a potential suspect, even his twin sister — who creepily refers to her brother as her "soul mate." Is Riverdale really going there with twin-cest and twin-tracide right out of the gate?
But we'll get to that later. First, let's meet the newest incarnations of the Archie gang and dig into all the secrets that the town of Riverdale is hiding.
New girl Veronica Lodge rolls into town fresh off her father's incarceration for fraud and embezzlement. Her mother Hermione (Marisol Nichols) claims their apartment is the only piece of property in her name and not her corrupt husband's, but after getting a duffel bag full of money anonymously delivered by their doorman Smithers (Tom McBeath), it's clear there is more going on than Veronica realizes.

The most interesting thing to note about The CW's version of the bratty, elitist rich girl from the comics is that Mendes has been given the green light to fully humanize Veronica. Where she was once evil and manipulative in the comics, now she's empathetic.
She's not perfect, of course, and still makes some mistakes — mostly where her new crush "Archiekins" is concerned — but she's committed to becoming a better person after realizing that she was basically a spoiled, entitled rich bitch before father's arrest. She's using her move to Riverdale as a fresh start, an opportunity to become the best version of herself. Finally, Veronica is a relatable character.
Meanwhile, classic girl-next-door Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) is hiding more than enough secrets of her own. Where Veronica is now a flawed hero in her own right — one who's even committed to helping Betty realize her full potential — Betty has enough baggage and emotional damage to employ a therapist full-time... but she would never admit to that.

2019-11-14 12:08:24,778 :: INFO :: I’ll only have one small glass of wine at the office holiday party. I’ll still make it to the gym three days a week. I won’t leave gift shopping until the last minute and stress myself out. These are promises plenty of us make to ourselves as the holiday season gets into full swing. And they’re promises most of us will break.
That's because it's easy for healthy intentions to go MIA when a coworker pulls together a last-minute happy hour plan, or you made yourself a way-too-long gift shopping list, or you took on another holiday-related responsibility that's throwing you off your game. 'Tis the season for excess, we know, but striving for balance and maintaining your usual healthy habits during December will also help you avoid starting the new year with a #dietstartstomorrow mentality.
To help you survive the month with your mind and body strong and begin 2018 on the right foot, we rounded up five simple things you can do right now.
RELATED: 5 Ways to Ease Holiday Stress in 5 Minutes or Less
Buy a pack of gym classes
Dropping some cash ahead of time for a 10-pack of classes or one-month class pass at your favorite fitness studio may be pricey. But knowing that they're already paid for will motivate you to keep up your sweat sessions all season long—because not even a holiday cookie swap can convince you to throw money out the window. Buy them now, and you'll have a few left over to use during the first week of January, so you're inspired to follow through on your New Year's fitness resolution as well.
Get cooking
Chances are you’ll catch up with friends over drinks or brunch this month. Instead of chatting over high-calorie eggs Benedict or cocktails, connect in a setting where healthy food is the focus—like a cooking class. Book a vegetarian class for you and your girlfriend ahead of time, or make a Sunday meal prep date now, so you’ll have nutritious meal options on hand when the holidays close in. Having good-for-you eats already prepped will help make last-minute holiday cookie dough binges less likely.

Slim down your holiday dinner
Heading to a festive potluck? Do a little research to find recipes similar to yours that use lower-fat ingredients, Wendy Bazilian, RD, nutritionist and co-author of Eat Clean, Stay Lean, suggested in a prior interview with Health. “Even better, find a version that incorporates some healthy foods that simultaneously bump up the nutrition while reducing extra calories, sugars, or fat.”
A few swap ideas we love: If you’re tasked with bringing dip to a party, substitute protein-rich Greek yogurt for sour cream. Or cook up whipped cauliflower instead of mashed potatoes. Hey, every bit counts.

The holiday season may be the most wonderful time of the year, but it’s also the most hectic, when your usual routine falls by the wayside and family and friends you've avoided all year long come back into your life.

To help you survive the month with your mind and body strong and begin 2018 on the right foot, we rounded up five simple things you can do right now.
Buy a pack of gym classes
Dropping some cash ahead of time for a 10-pack of classes or one-month class pass at your favorite fitness studio may be pricey. But knowing that they're already paid for will motivate you to keep up your sweat sessions all season long — because not even a holiday cookie swap can convince you to throw money out the window. Buy them now, and you'll have a few left over to use during the first week of January, so you're inspired to follow through on your New Year's fitness resolution as well.
Chances are you'll catch up with friends over drinks or brunch this month. Instead of chatting over high-calorie eggs Benedict or cocktails, connect in a setting where healthy food is the focus — like a cooking class. Book a vegetarian class for you and your girlfriend ahead of time, or make a Sunday meal prep date now, so you'll have nutritious meal options on hand when the holidays close in. Having good-for-you eats already prepped will help make last-minute holiday cookie dough binges less likely.
Slim down your holiday dinner
Heading to a festive potluck? Do a little research to find recipes similar to yours that use lower-fat ingredients, Wendy Bazilian, RD, nutritionist and co-author of Eat Clean, Stay Lean, suggested in a prior interview with Health. "Even better, find a version that incorporates some healthy foods that simultaneously bump up the nutrition while reducing extra calories, sugars, or fat."
A few swap ideas we love: If you're tasked with bringing dip to a party, substitute protein-rich Greek yogurt for sour cream. Or cook up whipped cauliflower instead of mashed potatoes. Hey, every bit counts.

The holiday season may be the most wonderful time of the year, but it's also the most hectic, when your usual routine falls by the wayside and family and friends you've avoided all year long come back into your life. Not surprisingly, your mental health can take a hit. To stress less this December, download one of these apps that take you through guided meditations and mindfulness exercises. We have a feeling they'll come in handy after your family talks politics at the dinner table.

Greg Jenkins
SAN FRANCISCO: Greg Jenkins has left China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba to start his own executive coaching firm, North Bay Strategies.
The firm officially launched Monday in San Francisco when its website went live . Its services include media and communications training, presentation coaching, and message development.
Asked to describe the clients in terms of sector, Jenkins responded, "It really runs the gamut. I'm building my client base now and will be talking to folks I've worked with in the past and new folks as well."
Jenkins added that he has been in talks with people in the San Francisco Bay Area for the past two weeks to "gauge interest" for "business development purposes." He explained that the firm isn't in expansion mode yet, but there are "some folks [he] would love to think about bringing on when the time is right."
"I want to get established in the Bay Area initially," Jenkins said.
At Alibaba, Jenkins was a director, serving on the comms, strategy, and planning team. He was part of the group that created the messaging framework and global communications framework as the Alibaba entered the world market. He joined Alibaba in 2014.
"While I'm grateful to Alibaba for the opportunity to be part of such an amazing company, [executive coaching] has always been a passion of mine," Jenkins said. "The opportunity was certainly there but it wasn't the focus of what I was there to do. I've been focusing on building out Alibaba's influencer program, which was about identifying key audiences and finding ways to keep them informed."
Leaving Alibaba at the end of September to start North Bay, Jenkins follows the lead of Jim Wilkinson, who was head of international corporate affairs before exiting the company earlier this year to start TrailRunner International. TrailRunner handles consulting work for Alibaba.
Wilkinson's replacement was Jennifer Kuperman, who spoke with PRWeek in April about Alibaba's strategy is to help businesses outside China access the country's market .
"[Jenkins] made many contributions to Alibaba during his tenure and we wish him the best with his new firm," Kuperman said.
Prior to joining Alibaba, Jenkins was a director at Brunswick Group. He worked at the White House as director of the office of global communication and, most recently, as deputy assistant to the president. He was a special assistant in the George W. Bush administration.
The first firm Jenkins started was Frontier International Communications, a Washington, D.C.-based shop. Clients included GE, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, McCain '08, and the San Antonio Spurs, according to Jenkins' LinkedIn profile.
"I will certainly bring my experiences with Alibaba and China's market to my coaching," Jenkins said. "But the coaching I will be focusing on primarily is not business development -- it's about communication."
This article was updated on October 21 to correct Jenkins' career history and his responsibilities at Alibaba.

Of course, the rankings often get bashed for what many feel is a poor reflection of how the teams should be ranked. Teams can also move up based on wins in friendlies, but t doesn't seem to do the greatest job valuing big-time wins. Argentina is No. 1, but No. 2 Brazil beat them 3-0 in World Cup Qualifying in November, and No. 4 Chile beat Argentina in the Copa America final this summer. Add to that the fact that Argentina won just one of its last five World Cup qualifiers, it's hard to make the case that the team is the best in South America, let alone the world.

HomeKit, Brillo, Alljoyn...Oh My! Seeking the Wizard of IoT
Things are changing so quickly in IoT that it would take a wizard to predict which ecosystem will gain the most traction. In order for IoT to reach its potential, smart devices must be able to work together. Today, there are a slew of interoperability standards being promoted by big names to make this happen: HomeKit, Brillo and Alljoyn.
In his session at @ThingsExpo, Adam Justice, vice president and general manager of Grid Connect, will review what happens when smart devices don't work together, and will look at each standard in detail, highlighting strengths and weaknesses. He will also look at whether standards can co-exist, and what it would take to make this happen.

2019-11-14 12:08:25,316 :: INFO :: Contently, a New York tech outfit that is emerging as a leader in the native advertising world, just landed $9 million in new funding from two venture capital firms  San Francisco-based Sigma West and Boston-based Sigma Prime Ventures, Media Ink has learned. "Content marketing has proven to be a powerful approach for companies of all sizes, building their brands and awareness," said Sigma Prime's Paul Flanagan . Among Contently's clients are General Electric, American Express, Pepsi and, on the media side, Forbes and Gawker. Shane Snow, chief creative officer of Contently, said his company "is a mix between two business models, a software technology company and a talent management company." Snow, along with CEO Joe Coleman, a boyhood friend from Idaho, and Chief Technology Officer Dave Goldberg, founded the company in 2010. About 80 percent of its revenue is derived from software and the other 20 percent comes from managing an extensive stable of writers  matching their editorial skills to advertisers looking to get a message across. Snow uses a network of more than 28,000 journalists to develop content. Of that number, he said, "about 5,000" are A-listers  drawn from top media companies which have been downsized or are simply looking to moonlight and earn extra income. Snow matches writers with brands and extracts a 15 percent fee. Generally writers are getting paid at the rate of around $1 a word. The company won't disclose its 2013 revenues, but Snow said they grew by 400 percent last year and he hopes to see them cross the $20 million barrier in 2014. Snow said that until recently, most of the expenditures for native advertising were coming out of public relations budgets, but more recently he noticed more of the funding coming out of traditional ad agency creative and marketing budgets. "There is going to be a lot of market share stolen from banner ads," he predicts. Native advertising is contracted content written and designed not to look like the advertising it really is. The larger debate that will undoubtedly play out across the media world this year is whether branded advertising threatens or helps traditional media  magazines, newspapers, TV and radio networks. "Right now this looks like a way for traditional publishers to make a premium on their page real estate," said Snow.

But then it's over, and you have a shower, and you sit down to blog about it, and it feels great. Running, that is. My analogy ended in the first paragraph. You weren't still trying to make it work for this one, were you? Anyway, I didn't do myself any favors by not running for nearly a week. In case you're curious, a combination of factors including illness, DIY-mania, and heavy rain contributed to my sloth. Tonight I went out thinking, "Do I really have to bother with the run-walk nonsense? Can't I just run out for 10 minutes, then run back for 10 minutes?" The answer is no. I did the same run as before, and by the end of the second repetition I looked over at my house (which faces the park) and seriously considered running home right then, jumping the fence, and going in the back door. Then I remembered that my back door was locked (safety first, kids!) and that in order to get home I'd have to go back the way I came, round the corner, and down the road again. And by the time I thought of all the logistics, my repetition was over. Later, something funny happened on my 4th repetition: I started running, and suddenly the 3 minutes was over, just like that. I thought I must have shortchanged myself or read my watch wrong, but no: it just went like a hot knife through butter. Mmmm, butter. Ahh, that's the other thing. I haven't had much food today, which might have contributed to my near crash early in the run. I tried to eat a toasted bacon and guacamole sandwich for lunch, but someone really needs to tell the ladies in the canteen that guacamole should only be served ice cold. Hot guacamole is nastified. Oh well, at least there were pink wafers in the tea room.

The **dragonfire shield** , also called **DFS**
draconic visage. When fully charged, it has the second greatest overall arcane
spirit shield having higher mage attack bonuses. Several shields have a higher
Prayer bonus and Summoning defence bonus. When completely uncharged, its stats
are somewhat better than a Defence level must be 75 or higher. This shield is
also unique for giving the highest strength bonus of any left-handed item. Its
strength bonus beats both the dragon defender by 1, allowing you to hit a
little higher without having a two-handed sword equipped. skeletal wyverns can
drop the draconic visage. The shield itself was a possible drop from anti-
dragon shield , only provides **partial** protection against dragonfire.
Unlike the anti-dragon shield, it also provides skeletal wyverns. The
Dragonfire shield's ability to protect against dragon breath does Edit
The shield absorbs dragonbreath from all dragons, and even ice breath from
Skeletal Wyverns, when equipped. Each dragonbreath, or ice breath, provides
one charge, up to a maximum number of 50 charges. Each charge increases the
shield's defence against stab, slash, crush, range and summoning attacks by
+1. The best place to charge a shield is anywhere with
metal dragons as when you move away from them they use their dragonbreath
faster than Chaos Tunnels are particularly good since they are in a
multicombat area; it is possible to have multiple Edit
When the shield is worn, players can also release charges of dragonbreath by
operating it.The Dragon Breath is so powerful it can hit things from 19 steps
away (maximum). To discharge the flame, right-click on the equipped shield
while in combat and select Activate. The shield will then fire a deadly blast
of fiery energy at the opponent, which hits up to 300 damage, but lowers the
stats of the shield by 1 for every charge used. Even if the shield is charged
with Ice breath from Skeletal Wyverns, only firebreath will be discharged,
rather than the ice breath some might expect. Players can also operate the
shield while not in combat and then target an opponent to release the attack
on. When fired, the attack will be long-ranged, and the player will run toward
the opponent to start fighting. The attack will not work against
Skeletal Wyverns. Using the dragonbreath attack against a monster will earn
Magic experience. The dragonbreath discharged is very, very accurate and is
commonly used as a sneak attack against an opponent. **Because of its great
accuracy, it could determine the outcome of the battle if both parties are
left with less than 300 lifepoints. This strategy is commonly used in duel
arenas as well as pvp. Be careful of opponent having a dragonfire shield in a
match.**
The damage of this attack is reduced just like a dragon's dragonbreath attack
if the opponent is wearing an
antifire potion. Once operated, the shield needs to cool down for exactly two
minutes before the player can unleash its flames again. The only other piece
of equipment to have this ability are dragon bolts (e) .
Since the shield is untradeable when charged, it must be discharged completely
before being sold; this can be done by right-clicking the shield in inventory
and clicking the
_empty_ option to release all remaining charges in a single, harmless burst.
The shield cannot be lent, whether it is charged or not. Edit Uncharged |

When a dragon breathes fire on a player wearing the shield, the player crouches behind the shield and does not make an attacking motion, however, the damage against the dragon still registers.
16 June 2009, players could get a dragonfire shield from PvP kills; however,
the aforementioned update removed dragonfire shields from PvP drop tables.
draconic visage weighs 1; however, when joined, the dragonfire shield's weight
increases to 7.2 kg.
In July 2010, the shield's appearance was updated so that both sides of the shield, the parts that were not covered by the visage, were orange. Previously, one side of the shield was orange, and the other side was the same colour as the visage.
The anti-dragon shield is held with the left hand when worn, however, when the draconic visage is attached to the anti-dragon shield, the dragonfire shield is attached to the forearm when equipped. It's possible that because of the shield's weight, the player has to get a better grip therefore holding it differently.
Due to the shield's ability to protect you from Skeletal Wyverns' ice breath (much like the elemental, mind and body shields), this shield is the absolute best option for the off-hand slot when fighting this monster. The ice breath of wyverns can also be used to charge the dragonfire shield, just as dragonfire breath can.
The shield's special attack raises defence experience when used versus other players.
Although the Anti-dragon shield has no magic attack penalty, the Dragonfire shield does.
The price of the Dragonfire shield is declining due to the release of the
Dragon defender . The Dragonfire shield has been less popular due to many
players' preference to wield the Dragon defender instead.
The Dragon Defender's strength bonus is comparable to the Dragonfire shield - where an obsidian shield's +5 strength bonus is shadowed by the Dragonfire shield's +7. A
Dragon defender not only gives a considerable +6 strength bonus, it also
boosts the best Attack bonuses for an item equipped in the shield slot, which
makes it a good replacement for the shield.

draconic visage. When fully charged, it has the second greatest overall arcane
spirit shield having higher mage attack bonuses. Several shields have a higher
Prayer bonus and Summoning defence bonus. When completely uncharged, its stats
are somewhat better than a Defence level must be 75 or higher. This shield is
also unique for giving the highest strength bonus of any left-handed item. Its
strength bonus beats both the dragon defender by 1, allowing you to hit a
little higher without having a two-handed sword equipped. skeletal wyverns can
drop the draconic visage. The shield itself was a possible drop from anti-

Unlike the anti-dragon shield, it also provides skeletal wyverns. The
Dragonfire shield's ability to protect against dragon breath does Edit
The shield absorbs dragonbreath from all dragons, and even ice breath from
Skeletal Wyverns, when equipped. Each dragonbreath, or ice breath, provides
one charge, up to a maximum number of 50 charges. Each charge increases the
shield's defence against stab, slash, crush, range and summoning attacks by
+1. The best place to charge a shield is anywhere with
metal dragons as when you move away from them they use their dragonbreath
faster than Chaos Tunnels are particularly good since they are in a
multicombat area; it is possible to have multiple Edit
When the shield is worn, players can also release charges of dragonbreath by
operating it.The Dragon Breath is so powerful it can hit things from 19 steps
away (maximum). To discharge the flame, right-click on the equipped shield
while in combat and select Activate. The shield will then fire a deadly blast
of fiery energy at the opponent, which hits up to 300 damage, but lowers the
stats of the shield by 1 for every charge used. Even if the shield is charged
with Ice breath from Skeletal Wyverns, only firebreath will be discharged,
rather than the ice breath some might expect. Players can also operate the
shield while not in combat and then target an opponent to release the attack
on. When fired, the attack will be long-ranged, and the player will run toward
the opponent to start fighting. The attack will not work against
Skeletal Wyverns. Using the dragonbreath attack against a monster will earn
Magic experience. The dragonbreath discharged is very, very accurate and is
commonly used as a sneak attack against an opponent. * * Because of its great
accuracy, it could determine the outcome of the battle if both parties are
left with less than 300 lifepoints. This strategy is commonly used in duel
arenas as well as pvp. Be careful of opponent having a dragonfire shield in a
match. * *
The damage of this attack is reduced just like a dragon's dragonbreath attack
if the opponent is wearing an
antifire potion. Once operated, the shield needs to cool down for exactly two
minutes before the player can unleash its flames again. The only other piece
of equipment to have this ability are dragon bolts (e) .
Since the shield is untradeable when charged, it must be discharged completely
before being sold; this can be done by right-clicking the shield in inventory
and clicking the
_empty_ option to release all remaining charges in a single, harmless burst.
The shield cannot be lent, whether it is charged or not. Edit Uncharged |

When a dragon breathes fire on a player wearing the shield, the player crouches behind the shield and does not make an attacking motion, however, the damage against the dragon still registers.
16 June 2009, players could get a dragonfire shield from PvP kills; however,
the aforementioned update removed dragonfire shields from PvP drop tables.
draconic visage weighs 1; however, when joined, the dragonfire shield's weight
increases to 7.2 kg.
In July 2010, the shield's appearance was updated so that both sides of the shield, the parts that were not covered by the visage, were orange. Previously, one side of the shield was orange, and the other side was the same colour as the visage.
The anti-dragon shield is held with the left hand when worn, however, when the draconic visage is attached to the anti-dragon shield, the dragonfire shield is attached to the forearm when equipped. It's possible that because of the shield's weight, the player has to get a better grip therefore holding it differently.
Due to the shield's ability to protect you from Skeletal Wyverns' ice breath (much like the elemental, mind and body shields), this shield is the absolute best option for the off-hand slot when fighting this monster. The ice breath of wyverns can also be used to charge the dragonfire shield, just as dragonfire breath can.
The shield's special attack raises defence experience when used versus other players.
Although the Anti-dragon shield has no magic attack penalty, the Dragonfire shield does.
The price of the Dragonfire shield is declining due to the release of the
Dragon defender . The Dragonfire shield has been less popular due to many
players' preference to wield the Dragon defender instead.
The Dragon Defender's strength bonus is comparable to the Dragonfire shield - where an obsidian shield's +5 strength bonus is shadowed by the Dragonfire shield's +7. A
Dragon defender not only gives a considerable +6 strength bonus, it also
boosts the best Attack bonuses for an item equipped in the shield slot, which
makes it a good replacement for the shield.

Nightmares to humanity and morally disgraced.
Tonight is filled with rage, violence in the air.
Children bred with ruthlessness, cause no one at home cares.
Tonight I lay my head down, but the pressure never stops.
Knowing that my sanity, content when I dropped.
But tomorrow I see change, a chance to build a new.
Build on spirit intent of heart and ideas based on truth.
Tomorrow I wake with second wind and strong because of pride.
I know I fought with all my heart to keep the dream alive.

2019-11-14 12:08:26,152 :: INFO :: Six mutual fund houses  Axis , HDFC , ICICI Prudential , SBI , Kotak and Union KBC  have launched closed-ended debt-oriented hybrid funds investing in a mix of fixed income instruments and stocks in January. These closed-ended hybrid funds invest approximately 80% of the money in high quality bonds, which over a three-year period, ensure return of capital. The remaining 20% of the money is invested in stocks, which offer extra kicker to the returns. Some products come with a five-year term, too. Most market participants look at these products as means to generate a bit higher post-tax returns than fixed deposits. "Closed-ended hybrid funds are good investment option for investors who need conservative exposure to equities and do not need liquidity," says Jignesh Harshadrai Shah, investment advisor of Capital Advisors. Though units of such schemes are listed on the stock exchange, they are rarely traded on the bourse. Investors typically get to exit at a steep discount to the prevailing net asset value of the scheme. In short, investors should be prepared to hold on to investments till the maturity of the scheme. Industry participants attribute the surge of such new fund offers to change in investors' preference and the current market scenario. "Retail investors are demanding safer mutual fund products," says G Pradeepkumar, chief executive officer of Union KBC Asset Management Company. Investors are more comfortable with these hybrid funds because they offer protection against any huge downside at the end of the tenure of the scheme and a little exposure to equity would provide extra returns, he adds. "Higher interest rates hovering in the range of 8-9% on three-year paper give scope for relatively higher exposure to equity of 20% in the current scenario in such funds," says Surajit Mishra,national head  mutual funds, Bajaj Capital . "Such products in the past have generated post-tax returns of 6.1-12% in the past," he adds. However, the "returns" depend on the extent of exposure to equity and how equities perform during the period. "Three years ago, the interest rates were lower than what they are today. That is why hybrid funds launched in those days are delivering low returns," says Mishra of Bajaj Capital. Low interest rate means that the fund manager has to put more money in fixed income instruments to ensure return of capital, leaving less allocation to equity. Also, the equity markets have not done well in the past three years. For example, CNX Nifty , the market bellwether index, delivered 2.31% in the three-year ended January 10. In fact, mutual funds are targeting investors who are keen to invest in equities but are afraid of losing money in the stock markets. However, everybody is not in favour of investing in hybrid funds. "Many hybrid funds have not lived up to the returns expectations of the investors. Investors are better off building such a structure for themselves," says Abhinav Angirish, managing director of investonline. in  an online mutual fund distribution entity. He asks investors to invest in a good debt fund and diversified equity fund with a good long-term performance record in the ratio of 80:20 with a three-year time frame. Many experts also believe that closed-ended hybrid funds are not tax-efficient. Capital gains of these schemes are taxed as a debt fund  lower of 20.6% with indexation and 10.3% without indexation. If an investor invests in a combination of debt and equity schemes, only the debt fund is taxed and equity fund returns are tax free after one year.

Professionals
Siemens Personalized Education Plan for Clinical Laboratory and Healthcare
Professionals
---
Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics introduces Personalized Education Plan (PEP):
the industry´s first competency-based clinical laboratory education model
focused exclusively on the individual.
---
Healthcare professionals, guided by their own instructional Avatar, are easily
able to plan a wide variety of product-specific, professional development and
job-relevant courses. And because PEP also tracks each individual´s training
path, it becomes easier for healthcare staff to monitor their progress as they
work towards achieving required knowledge proficiency requirements and
ensuring they remain current and compliant.
At a time when clinical laboratory managers face staffing shortages, cost
constraints, and greater workloads - all while helping healthcare providers
deliver quality patient care - the value of education becomes increasingly
important. PEP helps address many of these challenges with an innovative
approach to professional healthcare education. This includes a new standard
for competency-based education, administrative and tracking support for all
participants, along with the ability to mold the curriculum to support various
learning needs.
"Over the past four decades, the clinical laboratory diagnostics market has
relied heavily upon a 'train-the-trainer´ approach for laboratorians to
achieve mastery of sophisticated instrumentation, which can be inefficient and
expensive," said Chris Christopher, Vice President, Global Customer Solutions,
Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics. "By leveraging today´s IT and advanced
learning management systems, we developed Personalized Education Plan-a highly
innovative, competency-based learning approach that will dramatically change
the way our industry conducts training."
PEP offers customized laboratory education that blends interactive training
with hands-on practice and assessment to reinforce and internalize learning.
Online education is available anytime, anywhere, and is accessible and
convenient for all shifts and staff levels. The curricula are standardized and
evergreen, ensuring all staff receive consistent education regardless of
shift, location or tenure with the company.
"PEP will be a huge advantage to the laboratory because it will bring together
all the educational aspects that have always been available offsite and
online," says Marilyn Leonard, Chemistry Supervisor, White Plains Hospital,
White Plains, NY. "It´ll allow me to continually assess and guarantee that
everybody in the lab, 24/7, all the different shifts and staff levels-whether
full, part time or per diem employees-have the same level of competency."
Beyond a dynamic menu of online product training, PEP also offers education on
general laboratory topics and disease-state management. PEP consists of three
components:
My Planner:** Allows user and supervisor to design a Personal Education Plan
by selecting competency courses that support the specific job role.
My Curriculum:** Launches the user´s personal virtual workbook that contains
all the educational activities contained in the Planner. The user selects the
learning activities and completes them when and where it is convenient.
My Transcript:** The learner can track the progress and completion of all
online learning and hands-on activities as well as Continuing Education (CE)
credits earned.
The Personalized Education Plan is available exclusively to Siemens Healthcare
Diagnostics customers as part of the company´s Customer Care portfolio, which
includes services and support, education and training, and workflow
management. PEP is currently available in English and will soon be available
in multiple languages.
"Siemens has a long history of offering a blended approach to customer
training through access to our training centers, onsite education, regional
events, and technology-based education systems, which support training at a
distance," said Christopher. "With our Personalized Education Plan, we are
taking our educational support tools to the next level." Colin Booth to Speak

On Saturday, Republican Rep. Mike Coffman held an event for his constituents at a public library in Aurora, Colorado. At least 150 constituents showed up, most of them hoping to ask Coffman about his recent vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act and his plans for a replacement. But only about 70 people got to meet with Coffman: Despite booking a large room with ample space, Coffman allowed in only four constituents at once for five minutes at a time. When the crowd grew restless, police put up crime scene tape and Coffman snuck out the back door—six minutes before the event was scheduled to end.
Mark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.
Coffman co-authored a Denver Post op-ed on Friday urging the full and immediate repeal of the ACA. About 419,000 Coloradans have gained health care coverage since the enactment of the law, and many of them stand to lose their insurance if it is repealed. Yet Coffman has not proposed a clear replacement for the law, an issue constituents hoped to ask him about on Saturday. “I am potentially going to lose my health insurance,” Berthie Ruoff told NBC 9 while she waited to meet with her representative. “I've had a preexisting condition. I've had breast cancer. What's going to happen to me? My spouse who had health insurance passed away. What do I do? You know, what am I supposed to do?”

But neither Ruoff nor many other constituents who stand to lose coverage had an opportunity meet with Coffman. When it grew clear that Coffman would refuse to meet with a majority of those at the event, the crowd channeled its agitation into patriotic songs:

This show of unity, however, did not impress Coffman. Indeed, it appears to have scared him: Rather than address the crowd, Coffman had police officers secretly escort him out of the back door before the event was set to conclude.
While more than 100 people were waiting to meet with him, Mike Coffman sneaks out early from his own community event. #9News pic.twitter.com/NAZlXTKgQm — Nelson Garcia (@9NewsEducation) January 14, 2017
A few people noticed Coffman sneaking out and attempted to address him. “Next time,” one woman pleaded, “please be sure you hear all your constituents!” Coffman ignored them, hopped into a waiting car, and drove away. “Have a good afternoon!” yelled another exasperated woman.
In a statement released to NBC 9, Coffman insisted that “we only reserved the room at the Aurora Central Library for 90 minutes, which is usually plenty of time to see everyone,” and apologized to “those who were unable to see the congressman today.” While many in the crowd seemed to be under the impression that the event would be a town hall-style meeting, the statement claimed that that wasn’t the intended format:
Rep. Mike Coffman routinely hosts constituent one on one meetings across the district. Constituents are invited to meet individually with the congressman to express their opinions, seek help with a range of issues, and discuss legislation. Given the volume of people who came, the Congressman met with four people at a time for five minutes each for a total of more than 70 constituents.

2019-11-14 12:08:26,715 :: INFO :: Savings account lotteries: Win up to $25,000. LaVerne and DeAnn Brickner won $25,000 through their prize-linked savings account. Click the image above for more stories from winners. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) DeAnn Brickner dropped the phone on the living room floor when she got the call last January telling her that she and her husband, LaVerne, had just won $25,000. The couple had bought a handful of lottery tickets throughout the year, but it wasn't a Mega Millions or Powerball official on the phone -- it was someone from their local credit union. "[My wife] just stood there in shock ... I had no clue what was going on, I thought someone had died," said LaVerne, who is from Kearney, Neb. "We went to bed that night going, 'Wow, tell us this again when we wake up in the morning to make sure we're not dreaming.'" Across the country, states are passing legislation allowing credit unions to offer prize-linked savings accounts, where customers are entered into a lottery and given the chance to win an annual grand prize of up to $25,000. It all started in Michigan. Unlike most states, Michigan's law already allowed credit unions to offer games of chance, like a raffle or a lottery. In 2009, eight credit unions in the state began offering prize-linked certificates of deposit through a program called Save to Win. Since then, the program has grown its fleet of credit unions to 58, and the average savings account balance has increased from $734 to $2,873, with the majority of customers rolling over their 12-month CDs from year-to-year. That success has led other states to take notice. In addition to Michigan, six other states have passed laws allowing credit unions to offer prize-linked savings accounts, according to the Doorways to Dreams Fund, which helped launch the Save to Win program. Connecticut is the latest to do so, passing legislation last year, and a New York bill is expected to be reintroduced this year. And while federal law prohibits banks from running lotteries, a new bill introduced in Congress in October would make it possible for these institutions to offer prize-linked savings accounts in states that also permit it. Here's how it works: When you sign up for a 12-month CD and deposit at least $25, you receive one ticket for the lottery. Every $25 you add to the account after that qualifies you for another chance to win -- up to a maximum of 10 chances per month. But if you dip into that CD before its maturity date, you're typically charged a $25 fee, and you're only allowed to withdraw money once per term. Individual credit unions hold monthly drawings where you can win small prizes of $50 and up, and then there's an annual lottery run by all participating credit unions in the state that selects the grand prize winners. "When [participants] find out they get a prize, they are just ecstatic because most are hardworking, middle-class people," said Dave Adams, CEO of the Michigan Credit Union League. "These accounts are not geared toward people with lots of money, they're geared toward people who aren't regular savers." In a recent survey of Save to Win members, between 42% and 59% (depending on the state) described themselves as "non-regular savers," and between 35% and 55% said they earned less than $40,000. Save a million before you retire. Prize-linked savings accounts operate differently depending on the state. In Michigan, the credit union pays a subscription fee of between $1,000 and $10,000, which is pooled in order to pay out 10 annual grand prizes of $10,000 each. In Nebraska, there's only one grand prize winner per year, but the prize is $25,000. Since 2009, credit unions have doled out more than $1 million to more than 10,000 Save to Win customers -- with 22 people winning $10,000 or more. What's in it for credit unions? More deposits, and more loyal customers who may begin taking out loans or opening credit cards, says Adams. Between 55% and 75% of Save to Win customers said they are more likely to use another product at their credit union after using the prize-linked saving account. Overall, more than 40,000 Save to Win accounts have been opened and $70 million has been saved through the program between 2009 and 2012. Meanwhile, a recent study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that prize-linked savings accounts do indeed lead consumers to save more than a regular interest-bearing account. It also found that the product appeals most to men, consumers with low bank account balances and lottery players. More than 60 credit unions have also taken the initiative a step further and partnered with a company called SaveUp, which awards money and other prizes to members who do things like pay down debt. "Interest rates are so abysmal that they're not enough to motivate you to save ... these accounts actually do that," said Joanna Smith-Ramani, director of Scale Strategies at the Doorways to Dreams Fund.

“Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you,” Schumer told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow.
“So even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he’s being really dumb to do this.”
Trump said Tuesday evening that an intelligence briefing on Russia’s cyber activities “was delayed until Friday" and suggested that intelligence agencies weren't prepared. NBC News reported, however, that the briefing was always planned for Friday.
"The 'Intelligence' briefing on so-called 'Russian hacking' was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!" the president-elect wrote on Twitter.
Intelligence officials have reportedly determined that Russia tried to interfere in the U.S. presidential election to help Trump win the White House. President Obama has ordered a full report on the issue, and last week he put in place new sanctions against Russian intelligence organizations and individuals, in addition to expelling 35 Russian officials from the country and closing two stateside facilities used by the Russians for intelligence purposes.
Trump’s transition team responded to the initial reports about the CIA's findings by drawing comparisons to its intelligence about supposed weapons of mass destruction in the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq.
Schumer said that as he understands, intelligence officials are "very upset with how [Trump] has treated them and talked about them."
